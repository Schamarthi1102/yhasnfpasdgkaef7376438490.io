<p>This article details a project to test for Covid-19 positivity using state of the art information technology that integrates data analytics, predictions and machine language techniques. This proposed system entails collecting patient data using sensors, transmitting the data over the internet to a centralised analytics engine and apply self learning algorithms to derive at a probability of patients being infected with Covid-19.

This article cites previous work that uses a similar model to predict the mortality rate of Covid-19 infected patients among other works of similar nature.

<p>This article describes the efforts of department of public health, Augusta, Georgia to combat the Covid-19 pandemic by proactive administration of vaccination. The intervention comprised a vaccination point of distribution in one of the public schools in the district. The administration took every precaution to ensure the vaccination was orderly, safe and Covid-19 protocol compliant. Trained health care professionals were deployed throughout and were helped by community volunteers, police department, teachers etc. This program was conducted between mid-December 2020 and mid-May 2021. A total of 42,342 vaccinations were administered.

<p>This article is about the experiences of nurses and healthcare professionals that were working in the care of Covid-19 patients at the peak of the pandemic. This study was conducted among 831 respondents. The information gathered provided a unique insight from those at the front line of battle with Covid-19.		 
Many nurses mentioned a shortage of supplies like protective equipment, oxygen machines etc. They also talked about the stress of stringent Covid-19 protocols that required them to isolate themselves from immediate family. The long working hours, suffocating protective kits, zoom calls with their family added to the burden of caring for patients in critical conditions during a resource crunch. This is a vital study that can be used to prepare for future contingencies that should include professional counselling, emotional support besides adequate supplies and training.
